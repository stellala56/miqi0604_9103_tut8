  1. According to these pictures, I changed the circles to dots.
  2. I made the circles rotate because they all look like vortices.
  3. I made the circles on the background move because the background seems complex, full, and beautiful.

- ## Technical explaination

1. I wrote a set of code to change the appearance to dots when pressing the spacebar.
2. I added some variables to check whether users have pressed specific buttons.
